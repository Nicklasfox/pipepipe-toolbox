- A PipePipe/NewPipe backup file (.zip format)

## Installation

### Option 1: Download Executable (Recommended for Windows users)
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](../../releases) page
2. Extract the zip file
3. Run `PipePipe_Metadata_Tool.exe`

### Option 2: Run from Source
1. Clone this repository:

   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash

   ```

## Usage

1. **Select your backup file**: Click "Browse" next to "PipePipe Backup (.zip)" and select your backup file
2. **Optional: Add cookies file**: If you have a cookies.txt file for bypassing restrictions, select it
3. **Choose an action**:
   - **üîÑ Update Metadata**: Fetch fresh metadata for videos with missing information
   - **üßπ Clean Unavailable**: Remove videos that can't be accessed anymore
   - **‚ú® Do Both**: Perform both operations and create a new backup file

## How it Works

### Metadata Updates
The tool identifies videos in your local playlists that have default metadata (title: "YouTube Video", uploader: "YouTube Creator") and attempts to fetch fresh information using yt-dlp.

### Cleanup Process
Videos that couldn't be updated (usually due to being private, deleted, or region-blocked) are removed from your local playlists while preserving them in other playlists.

### Targeted Playlists
The tool specifically works with these local playlists:
- "Titta senare (PipePipe)" (Watch Later)
- "Videor som jag gillat (PipePipe)" (Liked Videos)

## Supported Languages

- üá¨üáß English (default)
- üá∏üá™ Svenska (Swedish)

## Technical Details

- **Database**: Works with SQLite databases from PipePipe/NewPipe
- **Video Processing**: Uses yt-dlp for metadata extraction
- **GUI Framework**: Built with Python Tkinter
- **Threading**: Background processing to keep UI responsive
